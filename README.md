# headset-controller
An app to configure wireless headphones.

This is meant to be a more lightweight replacement for software like the *SteelSeries Engine*. 

It's also mostly cross-platform.

## Why?
My problems with âœ¨*Gamer*âœ¨ software are perfectly expressed in [this rant by Adam from ShortCircuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jxeNPHhalc&t=578s).

> I finally have it downloaded, but every single short circuit we do on gaming headsets that have some sort of (censored) proprietary dumb (censored) software takes like an hour and a half longer than they need to, because we're always fumbling around with this extra bull (censored) that provides the consumer nothing in return, other than what?

Well, I'm a CS student and I agree. It shouldn't be that hard to make software that does exactly what it's supposed to do and nothing more.

The Windows build currently produces a single 5 MB executable that runs without installation.

## Installation

### Prebuilt Binaries

Prebuilt binaries can be found in the [**GitHub Release Section**](https://github.com/sidit77/headset-controller/releases).

Simply download the binary, copy it to your preferred directory, and run it.

### Building Yourself

This app is built using ðŸ¦€*Rust*ðŸ¦€, so you have to install it to build this project on your own.

After that, simply clone the source and build it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidit77/headset-controller.git
cd headset-controller
cargo build --release
```

#### Windows

On Windows, this program can be configured to use DirectX 11 for rendering instead of OpenGL. To build the DirectX version, run this command instead.
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features directx
```

#### Linux

On Linux, some additional packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev
```

#### macOS

I don't own a Mac, so I can't test this. It might work or not.
